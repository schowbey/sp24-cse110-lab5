1) I would not use a unit test because there are a lot of moving features. The functionality depends on interactions across users (presumably across servers), so unit testing is only sufficient to capture the quality of individual features rather the app as a whole. That being said, it is still a useful test for the different steps in sending/receiving messages.

2) I would use a unit test since this a specific case that checks the sending aspect of the application which is just a single feature.
